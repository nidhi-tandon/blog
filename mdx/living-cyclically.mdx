I recently read a few books about menstruation and it made me realise about the small changes I experience daily in myself are based on which cycle of the month I'm in and observing those changes has surprisingly simplified many aspects of my life. And to more surprise, this information was totally missing from the school books.

For those who are confused, I am referring to periods. It is a commonly clichéd topic.

So, here I am sharing few of my learnings and a brief guide on how to live your day-to-day life in sync with your cycle.

First and foremost, the menstrual cycle for women typically lasts **28-35 days**. This means that every 28-35 days, women experience bleeding, commonly referred to as menstruation bleeding or being "on our periods". The bleeding typically lasts for 3-7 days, with an average duration of 5 days. For some individuals, the first two days are characterised by heavy bleeding and significant pain or discomfort, while the last few days involve normal or lighter bleeding.

However, a woman's body prepares for this significant event **throughout the entire month**. It goes through different phases in the month to prepare the body and mind. The phases are - the follicular phase, ovulatory phase, luteal phase, and finally, the menstruation phase. This process occurs every month, starting from menarche (between the ages of 10-14) until menopause (between the ages of 40-50). So literally a women bleeds every month for almost 30-40 years of her life. Thats a lots of blood my dear.

Let's discuss the phases in more detail. These phases are commonly associated with the weather, such as **summer**, **spring**, **autumn**, and **winter** so its easier to relate.

As we know, the cycle length is 28-35 days.

Let's start with day 1. It's the first day of the **menstrual phase**, and there is heavy bleeding accompanied by a lot of pain, stomach cramps, nausea, discomfort, and headache. It feels as if someone is literally scratching the inside of the uterus (and I mean literally). You can compare this phase to being in the winter season. You feel sad and low on energy. Your attention moves inwards towards your body. You feel like staying in a cosy environment and warming yourself up.

After the period is over (usually after 3-7 days), the **follicular phase** begins. This phase usually lasts till day 13. During this phase, hormone levels peak and the "happy" period begins. This corresponds to Spring season . As you just came out of the periods, you feel light and ready to blossom. The energy starts to rise. .

From day 14, the **ovulation phase** begins. It is similar to Summer season where you feel extremely happy, energetic, positive, and may even feel like dancing around. More like beach vibes.

Next comes the **luteal phase**, like the autumn season. It's when energy drops, moods swing, you might feel a bit down, and motivation takes a dip.

From day 28 to day 5, winter season begins again – the period time. This cycle repeats.

Now, let's address the core question:

## How can we apply this information to our daily lives and embrace a cyclical approach?

<br/>

During days 1 to 5, when energy levels are low, consider taking a break from everything (specially day 1 or day 2) and indulging in relaxation.

It's a time to do nothing for a day, and personally, I often take 1 day off from everything urgent need based on how I feel. This is a crucial period for your body to heal and recover, so I deliberately slow down, eliminate distractions, and spend some quality time with myself.

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK565622/#_ch22_Sec2_ " target="_blank">Research</a> even suggests that menstrual pain can be as intense as heart attacks, underscoring the significance of this self-care period.

Few tips to take care of yourself in this phase - try heat pack, green teas, castor oil pack, some dark chocolate and some slow yoga, probably Yin-Yang yoga or meditation.

<br/>

Once the period is over, it's like hitting a reset button. You feel good and ready to get stuff done. Use this time to finish up things you've been putting off. It’s a productive time at work. Also start with some HIIT, heavy weight lifting, power yoga. Something that gets the blood rushing through your body.

<br/>

In the ovulation phase, the emotions are at its high. The productivity is at max. You are happy and ready to conquer the world. I do most of the work at this time. I can tackle difficult problem statements, be attentive in the meetings, give my best to improve the product and can finish off big chunk of work without getting tired. Obviously this all depends on other factors as well like the sleep pattern, nutrition and exercise.

<br/>

The luteal phase, the phase before the periods is a phase where you feel irritated, low on energy, unmotivated. I have observed I am usually distracted in this phase and could barely get the simple tasks done. So I usually tackle high priority tasks in this phase and restrain from starting something new. (Well not always..).

<br/>

This way, I can perform at my best when I feel my best. Some months follow the plan, while others might deviate – and that's okay. The key is to recognise your current phase and give your best accordingly and don’t be hard on yourself. I have seen that sometimes an entire’s months work can be done in the ovulation phase alone due to high energy and motivation level. For exercising in luteal phase, don’t stress your body too much. Go for some light workout and feel good yoga sequences.

Keeping track of my cycle helps me know when I'm most productive and when I need a break from work. I strongly suggest intentionally tracking your cycle, observing every decision made during each phase, and understanding how it aligns with your feelings at that time. Also if your periods are painful, go back in time and check for the last 2-3 months stress level, eating habits, sleep patterns. You will understand the reasons.

*Tip: Try seed cycling to improve the cycle.*

Ongoing research is still uncovering insights about women's cycles, providing valuable knowledge for those interested in living cyclically.

*I used the term "women" here, but in my mind, it encompasses all menstruating individuals, including trans and non-binary individuals.*
